## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Relations Not Working
**Problem**: Jobs don't link to clients properly
**Solution**: 
1. Check relation property is set to correct database
2. Verify "Show on related database" is checked
3. Delete and recreate relation if needed

#### Formulas Showing Errors
**Problem**: Formula properties show "Error"
**Solution**:
1. Check property name spelling (case-sensitive)
2. Verify relation path: `prop("Relation").prop("Property")`
3. Test formula step-by-step
4. Check for empty/null values

#### Rollups Not Calculating
**Problem**: Rollup shows 0 or blank
**Solution**:
1. Ensure relation exists and has data
2. Check filter conditions are correct
3. Verify property being rolled up has values
4. Refresh database view

#### Slow Performance
**Problem**: Database loads slowly
**Solution**:
1. Limit visible properties in views
2. Use filters to reduce displayed data
3. Archive completed jobs regularly
4. Check for complex nested formulas

#### Mobile Display Issues
